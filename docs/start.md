# Getting Started

This page instructs how to install and complete the initial setup for Linty.

## Install

You need to be using a Spigot or Spigot-based server. I recommend [Paper](https://papermc.io/software/paper).

Download the latest release. You can download Linty from any of the following:

- Download from Modrinth
- Download from Spigot
- [Download from GitHub](https://github.com/BogTheMudWing/Linty/releases/latest)

Move or copy the file you downloaded to `linty-*.jar` into your server's `plugins` folder, then start (or restart if already running) the server.

Linty has a first-time guided setup process. To start the guided setup, join the game. If you are not an operator, make yourself an operator with `op <username>`. Click the prompt in-game to begin the guided setup.
